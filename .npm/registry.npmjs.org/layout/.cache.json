docs/left-right.png\n[diagonal-img]: docs/diagonal.png\n[alt-diagonal-img]: docs/alt-diagonal.png\n[binary-tree-img]: docs/binary-tree.png\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall the module with: `npm install layout`\n\n```js\n// Load in layout\nvar layout = require('layout');\n\n// Generate a new layer to organize items on\nvar layer = layout('top-down');\n\n// Add items that you want to organize\nlayer.addItem({'height': 20, 'width': 10, 'meta': 'medium'});\nlayer.addItem({'height': 10, 'width': 10, 'meta': 'small'});\nlayer.addItem({'height': 50, 'width': 40, 'meta': 'large'});\n\n// Export the info\nvar info = layer['export']();\n\n// We get back the width and height of the pack as well as organized items\n{\n    height: 80,\n    width: 40,\n    items: [{\n        height: 10,\n        width: 10,\n        meta: 'small',\n        x: 0,\n        y: 0\n    }, {\n        height: 20,\n        width: 10,\n        meta: 'medium',\n        x: 0,\n        y: 10\n    }, {\n        height: 50,\n        width: 40,\n        meta: 'large',\n        x: 0,\n        y: 30\n    }]\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\nLayout is a constructor function\n\n```js\n/**\n * Layout adds items in an algorithmic fashion\n * @constructor\n * @param {String|Object} [algorithm=\"top-down\"] Name of algorithm or custom algorithm to use\n *   Available algorithms are listed in the Algorithms section\n * @param {Mixed} [options] Options to provide for the algorithm\n */\n```\n\nItems can be added via `addItem` which are required to have a `height` and `width`. Any additional info should be stored inside of `meta`.\n\n```js\n/**\n * @param {Object} item Item to store -- this currently is mutated in-memory\n * @param {Number} item.width Width of the item\n * @param {Number} item.height Height of the item\n * @param {Mixed} [item.meta] Any meta data you would like to store related to the item\n */\n```\n\n`export` is how you take your items and organize them.\n\n```js\n/**\n * @returns {Object} retObj\n * @returns {Number} retObj.height Height of the processed layout\n * @returns {Number} retObj.width Width of the processed layout\n * @returns {Mixed[]} retObj.items Organized items\n */\n```\n\n### Algorithms\nCurrently `layout` supports 5 different layout types which are listed below.\n\n#### `top-down`\nThe `top-down` algorithm places items vertically.\n\n![top-down image][top-down-img]\n\nBy default, it sorts from smallest (top) to largest (bottom). However, this can be disabled via `sort: false`.\n\n**Options:**\n\n- sort `Boolean` Flag to enable/disable sorting from smallest (top) to largest (bottom)\n    - By default, this is enabled (`true`)\n\n#### `left-right`\nThe `left-right` algorithm places items horizontally.\n\n![left-right image][left-right-img]\n\nBy default, it sorts from smallest (left) to largest (right). However, this can be disabled via `sort: false`.\n\n**Options:**\n\n- sort `Boolean` Flag to enable/disable sorting from smallest (left) to largest (right)\n    - By default, this is enabled (`true`)\n\n#### `diagonal`\nThe `diagonal` algorithm places items diagonally (top-left to bottom-right).\n\n![diagonal image][diagonal-img]\n\nBy default, it sorts from smallest (top-left) to largest (bottom-right). However, this can be disabled via `sort: false`.\n\n**Options:**\n\n- sort `Boolean` Flag to enable/disable sorting from smallest (top-left) to largest (bottom-right)\n    - By default, this is enabled (`true`)\n\n#### `alt-diagonal`\nThe `alt-diagonal` algorithm places items diagonally (top-right to bottom-left).\n\n![alt-diagonal image][alt-diagonal-img]\n\nBy default, it sorts from smallest (top-right) to largest (bottom-left). However, this can be disabled via `sort: false`.\n\n**Options:**\n\n- sort `Boolean` Flag to enable/disable sorting from smallest (top-right) to largest (bottom-left)\n    - By default, this is enabled (`true`)\n\n#### `binary-tree`\nThe `binary-tree` algorithm packs items via the [binary tree algorithm][].\n\nThis is an efficient way to pack items into the smallest container possible.\n\n[binary tree algorithm]: http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/\n\n![binary-tree image][binary-tree-img]\n\n### Custom algorithms\nYou can add your own algorithm via `layout.addAlgorithm`\n```js\n/**\n * Method to add new algorithms via\n * @param {String} name Name of algorithm\n * @param {Object} algorithm Algorithm to bind under name\n * @param {Function} algorithm.sort Algorithm to sort object by\n * @param {Function} algorithm.placeItems Algorithm to place items by\n */\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint via `npm run lint` and test via `npm test`.\n\n## Donating\nSupport this project and [others by twolfson][gratipay] via [gratipay][].\n\n[![Support via Gratipay][gratipay-badge]][gratipay]\n\n[gratipay-badge]: https://cdn.rawgit.com/gratipay/gratipay-badge/2.x.x/dist/gratipay.png\n[gratipay]: https://www.gratipay.com/twolfson/\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012-2014 Todd Wolfson\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"twolfson","email":"todd@twolfson.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-02-19T05:31:32.408Z","created":"2012-11-06T08:35:40.740Z","0.1.0":"2012-11-06T08:35:41.994Z","0.1.1":"2012-11-06T08:43:51.410Z","0.2.0":"2012-11-15T08:20:37.215Z","1.1.0":"2012-11-15T08:50:12.326Z","1.2.0":"2012-11-15T09:34:43.073Z","1.2.1":"2012-11-15T09:51:12.055Z","1.3.0":"2013-04-26T09:13:28.500Z","1.3.1":"2013-06-19T05:29:03.746Z","1.3.2":"2014-04-16T06:09:26.100Z","2.0.0":"2014-04-16T06:13:53.480Z","2.0.1":"2014-12-14T12:16:02.732Z","2.0.2":"2014-12-14T12:59:27.343Z","2.1.0":"2015-01-27T04:56:30.315Z","2.2.0":"2015-02-19T05:31:32.408Z"},"author":{"name":"Todd Wolfson","email":"todd@twolfson.com","url":"http://twolfson.com/"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/twolfson/layout.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/twolfson/layout","keywords":["layout","blueprint","organize","pack","algorithm"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/twolfson/layout/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"detj":true,"timdp":true,"moimikey":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"2a2cc4e22264861927e2dd431875e3fb\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 27 May 2018 06:30:20 GMT","_cached":true}
