Instead, that basic unit may be made up of multiple Unicode \n> code points. To avoid ambiguity with the computer use of the term character, this is called a user-perceived character. \n> For example, “G” + acute-accent is a user-perceived character: users think of it as a single character, yet is actually \n> represented by two Unicode code points. These user-perceived characters are approximated by what is called a grapheme cluster, \n> which can be determined programmatically.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install via npm\n\n    npm install grapheme-breaker\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar GraphemeBreaker = require('grapheme-breaker');\n\n// break a string into an array of grapheme clusters\n\n\nGraphemeBreaker.break('Z͑ͫ̓ͪ̂ͫ̽͏̴̙̤̞͉͚̯̞̠͍A̴̵̜̰͔ͫ͗͢L̠ͨͧͩ͘G̴̻͈͍͔̹̑͗̎̅͛́Ǫ̵̹̻̝̳͂̌̌͘!͖̬̰̙̗̿̋ͥͥ̂ͣ̐́́͜͞') // => ['Z͑ͫ̓ͪ̂ͫ̽͏̴̙̤̞͉͚̯̞̠͍', 'A̴̵̜̰͔ͫ͗͢', 'L̠ͨͧͩ͘', 'G̴̻͈͍͔̹̑͗̎̅͛́', 'Ǫ̵̹̻̝̳͂̌̌͘', '!͖̬̰̙̗̿̋ͥͥ̂ͣ̐́́͜͞']\n\n\n// or just count the number of grapheme clusters in a string\n\n\nGraphemeBreaker.countBreaks('Z͑ͫ̓ͪ̂ͫ̽͏̴̙̤̞͉͚̯̞̠͍A̴̵̜̰͔ͫ͗͢L̠ͨͧͩ͘G̴̻͈͍͔̹̑͗̎̅͛́Ǫ̵̹̻̝̳͂̌̌͘!͖̬̰̙̗̿̋ͥͥ̂ͣ̐́́͜͞') // => 6\n\n\n// use nextBreak and previousBreak to get break points starting \n// from anywhere in the string\nGraphemeBreaker.nextBreak('😜🇺🇸👍', 3) // => 6\nGraphemeBreaker.previousBreak('😜🇺🇸👍', 3) // => 2\n```\n\n## Development Notes\n\nIn order to use the library, you shouldn't need to know this, but if you're interested in\ncontributing or fixing bugs, these things might be of interest.\n\n* The `src/classes.coffee` file is automatically generated from `GraphemeBreakProperty.txt` in the Unicode \n  database by `src/generate_data.coffee`. It should be rare that you need to run this, but\n  you may if, for instance, you want to change the Unicode version.\n  \n* You can run the tests using `npm test`. They are written using `mocha`, and generated from\n  `GraphemeBreakTest.txt` from the Unicode database, which is included in the repository for performance\n  reasons while running them.\n\n##
